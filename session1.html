Introduction
<p>As previously mentioned, knitted fabrics have a variety of end-uses, such as dress wear bed linen upholstery, carpets etc. Knitting has developed into an important method of fabric manufacture and competes with woven fabrics for new share in the market. You Learned in the previous unit that woven fabric are made by interlacing of two sets of yarns, warp and weft. In knitted fabrics, usually we find only one set of yarns. In the Formation of knitted fabrics, yarns are formed into loops first and then these loops are interconnected. Depending on whether the set of yarn used for loop formation is lying in length- wise or cross-wise direction of the fabric produced, we distinguish between warp (length-wise) yearn while weft knitted fabrics are produced with a set of weft (cross-wise) yarns. Interconnected loops made from warps/ weft yarns are the structural elements of knitted fabrics. In this session, I wish to explain you how knitted fabric are made. further, the most imported technical terms associated with knitted fabric formation will be described.

<p><br><br><h1>1.1 Definitions and terminology</h1>

<h2><center>What is knitting?</h2>

Knitting is a process or method employed to produce textile planar (two dimensional) structures out of threads by interlooping. For the formation and liking of loops, different types of moving needles are employed. How loops are made from threads / yarns is illustrated in the figure


<h2><center>Weft knitting</h2> 
    <p>Weft knitting is the making of fabric by interloocking of yearns lying in weft wise direction as shown is figure In the case a large number of knitting needles are used to make loops from a horizontal thread and then to link these loops with loops fromed by second thread laid horizontallyon to the needles. in weft knitting, employ needleswich can be moved individually </p>

interlocking loops of the yearns lying in weft-wise direction as shown in figure.A large number of kitting needles are used to make loops from a horizontal thread and then to link these loops with loops fromed by a second thread laid horizontally on to the needles.In weft knitting,we employ needles wich can be moved individually.

 <h1>1.2 Basic Of loop formation</h1> 

New we can look at how loops are formed and interlocked in order to understand basics of loops formation.The figure illustrates how a weft knitted fabric is made by the use of some hooked needles (bearded needle).The Previously made fabric is hanging on the needles by the row of loops.As a new yarn is laid, the stinkers move forward against the needles.This movement bends the year to form loops.The bend at the edge of the sinker is called sinker loop, and the bend at the needles shaft is called needle loop.The next step is the downward movement of the needles and then the needles loop of the new yearn is caught by the hook of the needles. Soon after that, the beard should be pressed against the needle shaft, while the needles moves further downward.This allows needle to drow the needle loop of the new thread through the loop of the previous thread.Unltimately the black row of loops will slip out of the needles and hang on needle through the new row of loop hanging on the shaft of the needles

<h1>The Needle</h1>
<br>
<p>Now you have seen that for the infromation of loops and intermeshing, different knitting elements are requid. The most important knitting element is the needle. There are three different types of commonly used needls for knitting:</p>
<ul>
    *bearded needles<br>
    *Latch needles<br>
    *Compound needles<br>
</ul>
